Outline: parent class battleship.h, child class inheriting the parent: destroyer.h; will use torpoedos as a component  
 
unrelated class: a "board.h" of sorts is my idea, we already have X,Y stored in battleship.h  

component class: torpedoes.h -- has fields like damage that stores the damage, speed, any other cool torpedo things  

for main the "game" format exists to a degree already. Things we can add is if we make the board, some way of making an inRange type function to check if the enemy is in range. Maybe make it turn based, but this might be too exhaustive. 

I can't make it to campus today, but I have no classes on Thursday and can really hammer home the main and/or the testing.cpp on Thurs/Fri or if you want to meet somewhere on those days to discuss it.  

For now if you want to work on the destroyer.h or torpedo.h or board.h (or if you have a better idea for an unrelated class)  

If you could work on some of that while I'm gone today, I'll finish the rest when I have time tomorrow.  

If you just want to do the Lab for now that's fine too; maybe we can meet thursday/friday? Again I'm sorry but I can't make it today. - George
